Migration guide can be found in [the official documentation](https://developer.hava.io).

* Feature: Diff View
* Feature: Alerts 
* Feature: SNS display and connections
* Feature: Display connections for SQS to Lambda
* Feature: Display connections between DynamoDB and Lambda
* Feature: Added new CLI for management and troubleshooting 
* Feature: Display load balancer connections to WAFv2
* Feature: Display connect from S3 to SNS, SQS, and Lambda using notification configuration
* Feature: Display connections between API Gateway and Lambda
* Feature: Improve connection identification between route53 and CloudFront distributions
* Improvement: Updated pricing data for AWS, Azure, and GCP 
* Improvement: Simplified backend workers, now running combined workers rather than multiple types for easier management
* Improvement: Shares will now be removed when deleting an environment
* Improvement: Upgraded dependent libraries for exporting diagrams
* Improvement: API Gateway searches will now correctly return VPC Link resources
* Improvement: Improved resource identification in environment created  for default Kubernetes clusters
* Improvement: Fix email layouts
* Improvement: Improved user experience for adding new AWS sources
* Improvement: Give a useful error for the search if hit a 502
* Performance: Reviewed and added missing indexes to db
* Performance: Cache environment data between page loads
*  Security: Team member delete no longer returns details about the removed user. If the user doesnâ€™t exist it just returns success
* Security: Added limit to characters allowed on signup form
* Bug: Fixed issue with S3 signed URL creation for export jobs
* Bug: Fixed issue with logging of AWS Route Tables that have an unsupported type
* Bug: Fixed issue with missing default value for DynamoDB key_schema as it's not always defined
* Bug: Fixed issue with startup when values are missing by setting reasonable defaults
* Bug: Fixed attributes for Regional URL Map in GCP
* Bug: Fixed account selection after a login redirect
* Bug: Fixed issues with importing CloudRun resources that don't have push_config enabled

### Breaking Changes

* CORS defaults to disabled
* DNS Changes
   * Single DNS entry required now, rather than 3 used in the past. 
   * Ingress changes may trigger new deployment of Load Balancer and DNS will need to be updated in some cases
   * default subdomain has been changed to `hava`
* Several workers removed, custom scaling config needs to be updated
   * Build
   * import
   * render
   * report
   * worker
* [AWS] New cheaper storage class based on GP2 is the default
   * Ensure you update your config with the old storage class (`hava-ssd`) to ensure a smooth migration
